# Weekly Budget App
Started with boilerplate found here: https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate

This is a cross platform weekly budget desktop application to keep track of your daily purchases throughout
the week. Previous weeks are saved up to 12 weeks total. This is meant to be a **MANUAL** budget application and therefore, it does not interact with any 3rd party APIs.
